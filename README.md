# Restaurant-Randomizer
A little Python script to save your favorite restaurants in a given area and pick one at random. This script saves the restaurants and locations in a JSON file and then uses a random number generator to pick one for you, so you and your partner don't go "I don't know, what do you want" at each other for an hour
